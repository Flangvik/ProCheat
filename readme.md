# ProCheat
Let's take CS:GO Pro scene as a reference, if you have been following the scene for some while ,you have definitely 
seen these insane,out-of the world, shaky and "locking" type kill's once in the while. We all define this as the result of XK hours of gameplay,
pure intuition or just luck. But could it be more? How hard could it be to cheat on stage at a professional level?


## Every sport has cheaters
Baseball,football etc all have them, why don't we?
Price pool of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but not a single individual trying to take the short router?
What would stop these players from paying some experienced and skilled programmer/developer to make the tools that will guarantee them the victory?
Easy money right?


## All you need is your keyboard
This proof-of-concept demo show how the players on brought-along gear can inject cheats onto the tournament systems in seconds.

It took me 1-2 hours modifying this keyboard to give it these capabilities, all we need now is the cheat to deliver the system and your ready to go
(Not hard to find, private or public) 

## Anti-Virus, UAC and VAC
But what about Anti-Virus, UAC or VAC running on the system?
Both UAC and VAC is a fucking joke (at the current state) and can be bypassed easily
Computers used by the players in these events are usually Mid-Range style systems in no need of Anti-Virus
both to reduce performance drop and because the system is never exposed to the outside open internet. 


## Step-By-Step-By
Documentation, pictures and the step-by-step process of making this keyboard will be posted in the close future.
In short terms I disassembled the keyboard, located the 4 wires for the seconds USB 2.0 header/connection, split the power cable
over my own button that I replaced an original button on the keyboard with, split another female USB cable, soldered the wires and programmer/inserted the ducky
2 hours top's, no troubles and tons of room to work with (inside the keyboard, Thanks Corsair! ) 


## Conclusion, FIX?
It's a rather easy fix, make the ESEA Anti-Cheat client F**king mandatory on the tournament computers. 
ESEA Anti-Cheat client is the top of the line, privacy breaking, mem-dumping anti-cheat like no other.
