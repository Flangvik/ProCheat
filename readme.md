#ProCheat
Let's take CS:GO Pro scene as a reffence, if you have been following the scene for some while ,you have definently 
seen these insane,out-of the world, shaky and "locking" type kill's once in the while. We all define this as the result of XK hours of gameplay,
pure intuousen or just pure luck. But could it be more? How hard could it be to cheat on stage at a professinele level?


## Every sport has cheaters
Baseball,fotball etc all have them, why dont we?
Price pool of hounderes of thounsend of dollars, but not a single indivuldel trying to take the short router?
What would stop these players from paying some experineinved and skilled programmer/developer to make the tools that will gurantee them the vicurty?
Easy money right?


## All you need is your keyboard
This proof-of-conecpt demo show how the players on braugt-along gear can inject cheats onto the tourmenet systems in seconds.

It took me 1-2 hours modifiting this keyboard to give it these capasiblyiyes, all we need now is the cheat to deliver the system  and your ready to go
(Aint acetltyn hard to find, privat or public) 

## Anti-Virus, UAC and VAC
But what about Anti-Virus, UAC or VAC running on the system?
Both UAC and VAC is a fucking joke (atleast at the current state) and can be bypassed easily
Computers used by the players in these events are usually Mid-Range style systems in no need of Anti-Virus
both to reduce perfomance drop and beacuse the system is never exposded to the outside open internet. 


## Step-By-Step-By
Douctimation, pictures and the step-by-step proccess of making this keyboard will be posted in the close future.
In short terms i dissabmepmed the keyboard, located the 4 wires for the seconds USB 2.0 header/connection, split the power cable
over my own button that i reaplced an origiranl button on the keytboard with, slip another femaled USB cable, soldered the wires and programer/inserted the ducky
2 hours top's, no troubles and tons of room to work with (inside the keyboard, Thanks Corsair! ) 


## Conclusion, FIX?
It's a rather easy fix, make the ESEA Anti-Cheat client F**king mandatorty on the tourment computers. 
ESEA Anti-Cheat client is the top of the line, privacy breaking, mem-dumping anti-cheat like no other.
