# ProCheat
Let's take CS:GO Pro scene as a reference, if you have been following the scene for some while ,you have definitely 
seen these insane,out-of the world, shaky and "locking" type kill's once in the while. We all define this as the result of X * K/hours of gameplay,
pure intuition or just luck. But could it be more? How hard could it be to cheat on stage at a professional level?


## Every sport has cheaters
Baseball,football etc all have them, why don't we?
Price pool of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but not a single individual trying to take the short route?
What would stop these players from paying some experienced and skilled programmer/developer to make the tools that will guarantee them the victory?
Easy money right?


## All you need is your keyboard
This proof-of-concept demo show how the players on brought-along gear can inject cheats onto the tournament systems in seconds.

It took me 1-2 hours modifying this keyboard to give it these capabilities, all we need now is the cheat to deliver the system and your ready to go
(Not hard to find, private or public)

So what is happening here?
When i press and hold an spesific button on the keyboard, power will run to the Rubber-Ducky starting the execution of the script.
3-4 seconds later and the cheat is loaded and ready. 
In this case the button i "hijacked" was the Windows-Key-Lock button. 

## Anti-Virus, UAC and VAC
But what about Anti-Virus, UAC or VAC running on the system?.
Both UAC and VAC is a fucking joke (at the current state) and can be bypassed easily.
Computers used by the players in these events are usually Mid-Range style systems in no need of Anti-Virus
both to reduce performance drop and because the system is never exposed to the outside open internet. 


## Build Log
![Inside the keyboard](https://github.com/SkiddieTech/ProCheat/blob/master/Images/01.jpg)
So the install was pretty simple (Corsair made it very easy)
I cut off the right top corner of the keyboard PCB where the original button was and hot-glued in my own button.
The 2 USB cables used to connect to the keyboard split nicely into two headers inside of the keyboard, it made it extremely easy for me to disconnect the USB header that goes to the secondary USB port, split and solder on a female USB port for the rubby ducky. The powerline for this USB hub was split over my custom button so i could trigget the ducky at will. 
2 hours top's, no troubles and tons of room to work with (inside the keyboard, Thanks Corsair! )


## Conclusion, FIX?
It's a rather easy fix, make the ESEA Anti-Cheat client F**king mandatory on the tournament computers. 
ESEA Anti-Cheat client is the top of the line, privacy breaking, mem-dumping anti-cheat like no other.
You could (If not already implemented) add certain restrictions using the group policy system. However, this may or may not affect the efficiency of troubleshooting live problems for the IT Crew.
